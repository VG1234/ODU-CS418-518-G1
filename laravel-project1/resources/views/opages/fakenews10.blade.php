<p>This week, a massive beauty contest kicks off among North American cities competing to land Amazon’s second headquarters and its 50,000 job prize that promises to reshape the winning region’s economy for years to come.</p>
<p>Initial proposals are due no later than Thursday. San Diego aims to get a jump on competitors by delivering its bid to Amazon on Monday – complete with potential locations in downtown, Mission Valley, South Bay and Chula Vista that meet the Seattle-based e-commerce giant’s benchmarks for a second headquarters.</p>
<p>“Our key here in San Diego is going to be trying to compete on the talent front,” said Mark Cafferty, head of the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corp., which is piecing together the region’s proposal. “We heard definitely from Amazon here that the talent is what matters to them, in particular engineering and technical talent.”</p>
<p>Does this region have a chance? Competition will be fierce. Amazon estimates the average pay for workers at its second headquarters site will top $100,000 a year. The company expects to spend $5 billion on construction alone and attract tens of billions in additional investment in the community akin to the $38 billion of additional investments in Seattle’s economy over the past six years.</p>
<p>Some cities have set up war rooms where volunteers watch videos of Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos in hopes of better tailoring their proposals to his tastes. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said the state would offer $5 billion in tax breaks over a decade. Arizona business leaders in Tucson sent a 21-foot saguaro cactus to Amazon’s Seattle headquarters, which the company politely acknowledged on social media but declined to accept.<b> </b></p>
<p>“The fact that they have announced this and given us very little information to go on invites everybody and their mother to make a proposal, and they will,” said Gary London, a principal at London Moeder Advisors, a real estate consulting firm.</p>
<p>Two key questions loom large when handicapping San Diego’s prospects for landing Amazon’s HQ2: Is the company aiming to diversifying its geographic footprint away from the West Coast? How large a role will tax breaks, free land and other incentives play in its decision?</p>
<p>“Everybody I talk to in the region is a naysayer, so I am going to stay positive and say San Diego as a region meets and exceeds all their requirements,” said Eric Crockett, director of the economic development department for the city of Chula Vista. “Then it comes down to their corporate culture and whether or not other states are going to throw billions of dollars at them.”</p>
<p>This summer, the state of Wisconsin offered Apple contract manufacturer Foxconn $3 billion in tax breaks and incentives to lure a new flat screen display plant to the state that’s forecast to generate 3,000 to 13,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Pundits are pointing to Wisconsin’s $250,000 to $1 million per job incentive package as a benchmark for what some states might offer Amazon to land HQ2.</p>
<p>Amazon probably won’t get huge incentives in California, though state economic development officials have met with leaders from communities expected to submit bids – such as Los Angeles, the Bay Area, Orange County, Sacramento and San Diego – to discuss what can be done.</p>
<p>While incentives likely won’t match those of competitors, California can compete on other measures – namely a highly skilled work force, strong universities and quality of life.</p>

<p>In San Diego, Amazon recently increased its existing footprint by leasing more than 100,000 square feet of office space in University City, where it’s expected to employ more than 500 technical workers.</p>
<p>“Amazon’s experience in this market has been a good one,” said Cafferty. “They have said in no uncertain terms that they have been able to find the talent they need here.”</p>
<p><b>RANKING SAN DIEGO’S CHANCES:</b></p>

<p>Amazon’s request for proposals for its HQ2 project is just seven pages. But it does set down targets for what the company is looking for, and San Diego hits all of the minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Amazon prefers metro areas with more than 1 million people, a business friendly environment and a strong technical workforce. It also wants to be near major highways and within 45 minutes of an international airport with direct flights to Seattle, the Bay Area, Washington, D.C., and New York.</p>
<p>Amazon aims to occupy at least 500,000 square feet at its second headquarters site by 2019. Over the following decade or so, it expects to expand to 8 million square feet of buildings – roughly equivalent to what it occupies in downtown Seattle.</p>
<p>The company is seeking environmentally sustainable buildings, direct access to public transportation, recreational and education opportunities for employees and the right “cultural community fit.”</p>
<p>About 55 cities in the U.S. and Canada meet that criteria. Of those, 20 are best positioned to win Amazon, based on the criteria laid out by the company, said Joseph Parilla, a fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program.</p>
<p>San Diego is included in the top 20. But it ranks in 20<sup>th</sup> place, said Parilla. One reason: The technical labor pool – while high quality – is not as large as the technical workforce in the more populous places such as the Bay Area, New York or Chicago.</p>
<p>Parilla believes Amazon will ultimately base its HQ2 decision on a location where it can hire quality technical workers at scale.</p>
<p>“San Diego has a highly educated and particularly strong STEM workforce,” he said. “But it is not a huge place compared to others on this list in terms of the size of its technology labor pool.</p>
<p>“If you’re a highly educated place but don’t have the scale to absorb 50,000 workers potentially over a period of time, then you would be at a bit of a handicap,” he said.</p>
